      The one-column block is useful for short explanations, introductions, and narrative content. This example uses the optional secondary background colour on the block itself.

          The southern cassowary and Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo are strongly associated with Wet Tropics rainforest. They rely on connected habitat and healthy native vegetation.
      - title: "Coastal and marine species"
        content: |
          Estuarine crocodiles and green turtles connect freshwater, coastal, and reef systems. Their life cycles are shaped by water quality, nesting habitat, and climate.

      Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo is an arboreal marsupial of the Wet Tropics. It moves through the forest canopy and is vulnerable to habitat fragmentation.
