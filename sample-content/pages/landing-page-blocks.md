      Required: `title`.

      Add `image` to place media beside the text. The image sits on the right by default.

      Optional: set `image_position: "left"` to reverse the layout.

    eyebrow: "Media"
    image_position: "left"

    content: |
      Use `style: "feature"` for a full-width pale background band. It uses `secondary_color` from `_config.yml`.

      Good for project summaries, research focus areas, or sections that need gentle emphasis.
  - title: "Highlight band"
    eyebrow: "Style"
    style: "highlight"
    content: |
      Use `style: "highlight"` for a strong full-width band using `primary_color`.

## How to use landing page blocks

Create a page with `layout: full-width`, then add the front matter groups you need. You can omit whole groups if a full-width page does not need them.

The main groups are `hero`, `achievements`, `carousel`, `landing_sections`, and `partner_organisations`.

The only group most landing pages should always have is `hero`. Everything else is optional and can be added as the project grows.
